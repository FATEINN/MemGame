# Ben's Memory Game

In my Fend Udacity course, I had to create a memory game where upon clicked, two cards match and stay open. Once all cards are matched, a popup message appears and congratulates the tester for winning the game. The popup gives a score from 1 to 5, how much time it took, and how many moves it took to finish the game. 


## How to Play the Game?

1. In a directory, open a terminal and enter: git clone https://github.com/Ul1ra/MemoryGame

2. Open the directory and open the index.html.

3. Play the game
